We've taken a snapshot of the entire end-to-end service that was deployed on 3 January 2023.

## Something important about the service

This service is only for circus professionals who:

   - **need to juggle legally**, as it is dangerous juggling without a licence 
   - **have the skills to juggle**, so users must have trained extensively before applying for a juggling licence

We need to understand if circus professionals can apply for their juggling licence using our service.
