Our service is for fully trained circus professionals only. Users that are not fully trained circus professionals cannot use our service. 

## The issue
Many juggling licence applications are not made by circus professionals, leading to many licence applications being rejected. Despite information on the start page explaining who can apply, non-circus professionals are still applying for a juggling licence.

## What we did
We have introduced a kick out page after asking, 'How many balls can you juggle?' If their answer is less than three balls, the user goes to a page that tells them they are not eligible to apply for a juggling licence.

## Initial results
We tested the ineligible journey with non-circus professionals and circus professionals. We found most users had no difficulty with this journey and understood what had happened to their application. [User research findings of the usability testing](#).

## Next steps
The ineligible journey will go into development in the coming sprints.
